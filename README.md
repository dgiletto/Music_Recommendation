- Description
    - This is a music recommendation model which is employed on many different music streaming services such as spotify or apple music. It takes a track which you may enjoy listening to and find songs that either sound like it, or listened to by other people who like that song. In this project, we take datasets providing information like audio features and songs users listen to, to create 2 different models based on these ideas.

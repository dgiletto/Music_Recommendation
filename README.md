## Description
- This is a music recommendation model which is employed on many different music streaming services such as spotify or apple music. It takes a track which you may enjoy listening to and find songs that sound like it. In this project, we take datasets providing information like audio features and turn them into something tangible which can give users some new songs to listen to!
